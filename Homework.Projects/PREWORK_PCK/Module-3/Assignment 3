Assignment #3

I feel as if the first challenge will be my biggest opponent for the next 24 weeks. I am well aware that this is not going to be a walk in the park, but Iâ€™d like to think that I pick things up quickly and efficiently. I have not been to school in over 5 years, and have become a guru in my current field. Going from first to worst is definitely going to be a struggle. Overcoming defeat or failure will be a process, but not impossible. I simply have to take everything one step at a time and understand that I will not pick up every language after just one class. I am dedicated to put in the time needed to be successful, hopefully this will help me fail less and keep my head up.
