admin or user start >> node (CLI.js admin myUserName "highland Park, Tx")

- admin myUserName
- then is shows you the history of searches (user and location)





- capture Process.argv[2,3,4]
- check the type of user - process.argv[2]
- user input in on location and search for weather for that location
- ajax call / module will do the call to weather-js object
- write searches to log file 
- read from log file
- include fs module to write and read
- output to console the results 


- we want to make objects with variable and function that define similar functionallity; divvy up responsibilities into different object
- use constructors to make these objects
- call various functions as per the app logic


object = state (vars) and behavior (functions)

1. initCode (CLI)= find of admin or user: then call adminFun or userFunc

2. search object (UserSearch) ==> function search (){}; may be it keeps 
    name, location info as variables

3. write and read object (WeatherAdmin) => function to write and read
    - 2 functions:
    - adminFun: (reading the file)
    - user: (will be doing search (=> call the search function in
     the Search object) AND be writting to log file)


ENTRY point == InitCode => then 
- WeatherAdmin.admin or WeatherAdmin.user



ADMIN SHOWS PERVIOUS SEARCH AND USERS
USER PROVIDES LOCATION AND IS GIVEN WEATHER
